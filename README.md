## Overview:

- Our idea is to create a mock version of the GHP Student site with a phishing popup (no data is actually taken or harmed) that links to our project site, which educates the user on the importance of internet safety and the dangers/potential of malware/phishing sites.
- As for the scope of the project, we plan to combine our skill sets of malware and web development to create a website with research and informative guides.
- We plan on informing the user of how phishing sites operate with tips and advice as well as a video showcasing an example of how malware can target personal devices using a homemade malware platform (the malware program will not be accessible by the user it is only shown in a video).
