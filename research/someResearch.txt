This is some research that we can put on the website:

common attack vectors:

	phishing:
		Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where a
		malicious party pretends to be some other legitimate party with
		the intent of getting a target to preform some action, usually
		sending sensitive data.

		A good example of this is a phishing website such as this one
		that attempts to get the target to download and execute malware
		on their computer by telling the user that the malware is a
		browser update.

		Phishing can also take the form of an email or text scam where
		the attacker pretends to be some legitimate party
		(ie: the govt., your boss, a family member) in order to get you
		to send them sensitive data.

	weak credentials:
		Weak or reused passwords can lead to significant
		vulnerabilities. If a password is weak (common passwords
		such as 12345, or short passwords) it can be highly vulnerable
		to brute force attacks. If you reuse a password, and that
		password is leaked in a data breach, an attacker could see that
		and try using that password for other things.

		The easiest way to avoid any risks with weak passwords is to
		always use long, unique passwords with many type of characters
